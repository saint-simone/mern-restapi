## MERN REST API
This section provides a clear overview of both the production and development dependencies used in my MERN REST API project, along with brief descriptions of each package's purpose and their current versions. I've also included basic commands to help users get started with the project.

### Core Dependencies
- **express** (^4.21.1) - Fast, unopinionated web framework for Node.js
- **mongoose** (^8.8.1) - MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment
- **dotenv** (^16.4.5) - Zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file
- **colors** (^1.4.0) - Add colors and styles to node.js console output
- **express-async-handler** (^1.2.0) - Middleware for handling exceptions inside of async Express routes

### Development Dependencies
- **nodemon** (^3.1.7) - Development utility that monitors for changes and automatically restarts the server

## Getting Started
